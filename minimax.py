# ==================== 0. Evaluation & Utilities ==================

# If the amount of cubes on the table is 0, the last player to pick up cubes off the table is the winner.
# State evaluation is set on the MAX player's perspective (PC), so if he wins he gets eval +100. If he loses, his eval is set to -100. 
# In states with a negative amount of cubes availiable on the table, the last person played is the loser.
# If the current state is not final, we don't care on the current evaluation so we simply initialise it to 0.
